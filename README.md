# Paint to Bin Script (Sega Genesis / Megadrive)
A Python Script that convert a picture into a binary file for editing Sega Genesis/Megadrive sprites. Compatible with the [YY-CHR tool](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/).

###Step
1. After downloading the script, create an Virtual Environment and add the PIL Lib. [Check tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAvAlS0CuxI)
2. Run the script. The picture you will choose have to be **128 width long and the height has to be a multiple of 8**
3. To make the color picking easier, **add the palette at the top left of the picture** as seen below.

To verify if there are 16 colors, open the picture in a software using palette (eg. GIMP)
4. Once you select a picture, a new bin will be created, ready to be used for the YY-CHR tool.
